@11   = ~After leaving <CHARNAME>'s company, Korgan Bloodaxe lived a life full of adventure. He took control of an entire dwarven clan, beat their leader in a duel and changed their lust for vengeance to a lust for making money. He could have lived in luxury but his thirst for adventure was insatiable, and he stunned the Realms by pushing deep into the Underdark. The clan's brave attack took even the dark elves by surprise, but occupying territory in the home of the drow is a hopeless proposition. Korgan was last seen covering a retreat of his unit against a drow counterattack. The dwarves managed to recover his body at a high cost. At Korgan's funeral, the halfling Mazzy Fenton was present as a guest of honor, as her opinion was always very important to Korgan. Dwarven legends immortalized this image, and a common friendship was depicted as a passionate romance. History, it seems, finds more romances than true friendships.~
