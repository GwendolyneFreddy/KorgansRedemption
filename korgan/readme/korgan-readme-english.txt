Korgan's Redemption

Mod for BG2:ToB 
Author: Picollo

This mod was inspired by a discussion on CoB about content removed from ToB.

The mod provides the possibility of redeeming Korgan if Mazzy is in your party.

You will NOT be able to stop this redemption nor help it. In the vanilla game, banters between Mazzy and Korgan suggested the possibility of changing Korgan, and I wanted to keep it like the original.

It's recommended to start a new SoA game to be able to see the whole relationship between them. But I'm adding content only for ToB.

If you are starting new ToB game, you should have Mazzy in party before Korgan.

Please report all problems with this mod at the CoB forum and we will respond to them ( http://athkatla.cob-bg.pl/viewtopic.php?t=4669 ).
